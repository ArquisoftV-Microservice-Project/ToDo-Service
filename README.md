# TODOs API

This service is written in NodeJS, it provides CRUD operations over TODO entries.
It keeps all the data in memory. CREATE and DELETE operations are logged by
sending appropriate message to a Redis queue. The messages are then processed by
`log-message-processor`.

## 🚀 CI/CD Workflow

The `.github/workflows/build.yml` file defines a GitHub Action that performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout the code**: Retrieves the source code from the `main` branch.
2. **Authenticate with GCP**: Uses a service account (`GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS`) to authenticate with Google Cloud.
3. **Set up GCP SDK**: Installs and configures the `gcloud` CLI.
4. **Configure Docker with Artifact Registry**: Allows Docker to push images to GCP’s container registry.
5. **Get GKE credentials**: Connects to the GKE cluster to run `kubectl` commands.
6. **Set image tag**: Generates a unique image tag per commit using the branch name and timestamp.
7. **Build Docker image**: Builds and tags the Docker image with both the generated tag and `latest`.
8. **Push the image**: Pushes both `latest` and timestamped tags to GCP's Artifact Registry.
9. **Update deployment on GKE**: If a deployment named `frontend` exists, it updates the container image for `frontend-container`.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To make the workflow run successfully, you need to set up the following in your GitHub repository:

### 🔐 Secrets

- `GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS`: JSON with credentials for a service account that has permissions for:
  - Artifact Registry
  - GKE (get-credentials and set image)
- `GCP_PROJECT`: Google Cloud project ID
- `GKE_CLUSTER`: Name of your GKE cluster

### ⚙️ Variables

- `GCP_ZONE`: Zone where the cluster is located (e.g. `us-central1`)
- `REGISTRY`: Artifact Registry repository name (e.g. `my-registry`)
- `IMAGE_NAME`: Name of the image to be built (e.g. `frontend`)

---

## 🐳 Docker

This project includes a `Dockerfile` that packages the app for production. Make sure the Dockerfile is properly configured for your production environment.

## 🖥️ Local Development

- `GET /todos` - list all TODOs for a given user
- `POST /todos` - create new TODO
- `DELETE /todos/:taskId` - delete a TODO by ID

TODO object looks like this:

```
{
    id: 1,
    userId: 1,
    content: "Create new todo"
}
```

Log message looks like this:

```
{
    opName: CREATE,
    username: username,
    todoId: 5,
}
```

## Configuration

The service scans environment for variables:

- `TODO_API_PORT` - the port the service takes.
- `JWT_SECRET` - secret value for JWT token processing. Must be the same amongst all components.
- `REDIS_HOST` - host of Redis
- `REDIS_PORT` - port of Redis
- `REDIS_CHANNEL` - channel the processor is going to listen to

## Building

```
npm install
```

## Running

```
JWT_SECRET=PRFT TODO_API_PORT=8082 npm start
```

## Usage

In case you need to test this API, you can use it as follows:

```
 curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" http://127.0.0.1:8082/todos -d '{"content": "deal with that"}'
```

where `$token` is the response you get from [Auth API](/auth-api).
